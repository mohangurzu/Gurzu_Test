### How is the exam graded?

We are looking for idiomatic use of JavaScript, and the ability to solve the problem with code that is clean and easy to
read. Please show us how you would use the language and conventions to structure things in a clear and maintainable way.

Even though we are not giving you the UI design, we believe that as a Frontend Developer you should have some ideas of
how it should look. You are free to use any styling tools that you want, SASS, css-in-js, or even styled-components.
